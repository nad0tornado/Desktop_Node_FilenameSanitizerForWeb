### Node JS + Typescript

... Replaces all illegal characters in file names with respect to URL rules ... except slashes

I originally created this script when my Asp.NET web project wouldn't build because I had some illegal characters in some of my files. I had hundreds of files, and I'm a lazy person, so I wrote a script to do the whole thing in a fraction of a second. What a great time to be alive.
